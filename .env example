# JWT Configuration

# generate JWT_SECRET by running on node:

# node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"

# Keep different secrets for development, staging, and production environments

# Regularly rotate the secret in production environments

# expiresIn: expressed in seconds or a string describing a time span vercel/ms.

# Eg: 60, "2 days", "10h", "7d". A numeric value is interpreted as a seconds count. If you use a string be sure you provide the time units (days, hours, etc), otherwise milliseconds unit is used by default ("120" is equal to "120ms").
